# Homehopper README

## What is Homehopper?

This is an Airbnb-like application built with Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and NextAuth. Users can search for and book accommodations, as well as create and manage their own listings. The application will include features such as user authentication, payment processing, and booking management. The application will be built with a mobile-first approach, and will be fully responsive.

## What is the purpose of this application?

This application is a personal project that I am building to learn more about Next.js, TypeScript, and NextAuth(Authjs). I am also using this project to learn more Prisma ORM.

## What is the current status of the application?

The application is currently in development.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `app/pages/api/hello.tsx`.
